# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Analysis

About the company

This is an analysis of a churn dataset for a Telecommunications company that provides phone and internet services to customers in california. 
The dataset details about customer demographics, location, services, and current status.

Business Task

The business task is discovering why some customers stopped using our services and how we can retain more customers. My analysis is aimed at discovering the categories of customers based on the customer status (the customer status groups customers into three: customers that churned, stayed and joined recently).
I will be uncovering customers' pain point; how each categories of customers differ from each other, etc.

Questions my analysis will answer

1. What are the most common reasons customers leave? 
2. Are we losing high-value customers? High-value with regards to revenue.
3. What steps can we take to retain more customers?
