About the company
This is an analysis of a churn dataset for a Telecommunications company that provides phone and internet services to customers in california. 
The dataset details about customer demographics, location, services, and current status.

Business Task
The business task is discovering why some customers stopped using our services and how we can retain more customers.
My analysis is aimed at discovering the categories of customers based on the customer status (the customer status groups customers into three: customers that churned, stayed and joined recently).
I will be uncovering customers' pain point; how each categories of customers differ from each other, etc.

Questions my analysis will answer
1. What are the most common reasons customers leave? 
2. Are we losing high-value customers? High-value with regards to revenue.
3. What steps can we take to retain more customers?

#This dataset was gotten from Maven Analytics data playground. I am going to commence the data analysis process by cleaning the data. I'll be checking for duplicate tables; any records that are outliers in the age, gender, marital status and other important tables.

/*From the results, we see that age grades that have stayed the longest I.e. 6 years are the top revenue bringers. 
Our highest number of users fall within ages 42, 47, and 40.  However, the top 3 ages that brought in the largest revenue are 56, 46 and 75 and they've stayed with us for the longest time.
I am going to check if people within the our highest revenue ages have churned. 

FIRST, LET ME REPRESENT THE PREVIOUS DATA IN PERCENTAGE. ( I'll adress this later)

# WE WILL REP THIS IN % later

 
# Let's dive deeper into this churn data and seen the most common reasons for customer churn.
/* 
Based on our results, we see that we lost 841 people to a competitor, 321 to dissatisfaction, 314 to attitude, 211 to price and 182 to other. Therefore,we've lost most customers to another/other telecom companies.
Based on this, we have to find out what other competitors have that we don't have (I don't have access to that data).
We need to answer the question of "Why are customers staying?" and "What is the difference between customers that stayed and the ones that left?"
